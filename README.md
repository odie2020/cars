#### This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
###### The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
	1. This will prompt the user to enter a new car. They will be asked to enter the:
	Year, Make, and Model of the car.
	2. Display a list of the existing cars that have been previously entered.
	3. Will exit the program and display a "Goodbye" message.
